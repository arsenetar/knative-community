## Contributions to Knative

I have made several direct contributions to fix several issues we have encountered in our use of
Knative in our environments:

- [Serving PR 14303](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/14303)
- [Serving PR 14347](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/14347)
- [Serving PR 14543](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/14543)
- [Kourier PR 1199](https://github.com/knative-extensions/net-kourier/pull/1199)

## Why I'm Running

At CoreWeave we provide a semi-managed Serverless solution in one of our environments which runs on
top of Knative Serving with some customers leveraging KServe as well on top.  In other environments,
we provide a standardized installation customers can use to install Knative Serving with our
recommended defaults tailored for generative AI inference.  The primary use-case for our customers
and us revolves around generative AI inference which has some unique challenges compared to
traditional serverless workloads.

I work on our Machine Learning (ML) infrastructure for training and inference to support the
use-cases of our customers.  I would like to be able to provide more direct feedback from these
use-cases to Knative as well as help us better leverage and interact with the project going
forward.  We have several initiatives around inference, and historically Knative Serving has been a
critical component to the solutions.
